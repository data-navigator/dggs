# Elements of a Discrete Global Grid

This document expands upon the definitions of geometric elements found in
Euclid's Elements Book I, to define the equivalent concept in a Discrete Global
Grid.

## Point

'A point is that which has no part.' - In a DGG a point is represented by an
individual cell at any level of resolution, if that cell is at the highest
resolution present in the grid. This is because an individual at high resolution
is the smallest unit available to the grid.

## Line

'A line is breadthless length' - In a DGG a line is a group of individual cells
lying evenly between two points. This is analogous to a cartesian line being an
infinite series of points between two endpoints.

## Surface

'A surface is that which has length and breadth only.' - In a DGG a surface is a
group of individual cells that fall between three or more points. This is
analogous to a cartesian surface which must be formed by three or more vertices.
